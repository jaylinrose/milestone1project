            You can trigger NightBorne's super attack, or soul-reaper-death explosion by guessing the hidden pattern correct. The hidden pattern consist of a sequence of selected arrow keys on the keyboard: left, right, up, and down. Everytime a key that is selected is correct, the light next to the pattern bar will turn green. If incorrect, the light will turn red and your progress to solving the pattern will be reset. However, no initial pattern for replication is given. The player will have to obtain "hints" to the correct pattern by making guesses and tracking their progress with the pattern bar as they go. Crack the correct pattern and NightBorne will unleash their super attack and defeat the enemy. Fail to guess the pattern correctly before the time runs out and NightBorne dies, the player loses.
