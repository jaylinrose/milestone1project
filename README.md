//Definition of A Power Move- Milestone 1 Browser Game

//game dev background

Hello! Featured is a memory combined chance pattern game. The game starts out with two characters in idle position. The playable character set on the left and the enemy on the right. This playable charatcter, NightBorne, is very powerful. However, their power is limited to that of a single explosive strike, nothing else. Yup, NightBorne is THE one-shotter. So, let me explain how to trigger NightBorne's attack.

//Game Mechanics

You can trigger NightBorne's super attack, or soul-reaper-death explosion by guessing the hidden pattern correct. The hidden pattern consist of a sequence of selected arrow keys on the keyboard: left, right, up, and down. Everytime a key that is selected is correct, the light next to the pattern bar will turn green. If incorrect, the light will turn red and your progress to solving the pattern will be reset. However, no initial pattern for replication is given. The player will have to obtain "hints" to the correct pattern by making guesses and tracking their progress with the pattern bar as they go. Crack the correct pattern and NightBorne will unleash their super attack and defeat the enemy. Fail to guess the pattern correctly before the time runs out and NightBorne dies, the player loses. 

//Game Expansion

The current launched game has ways to grow and develop. Main highlight being the game is designed as only one level, whereas in hindsight the game would have multiple levels increasing in difficulty and changing NighBorne's attack mechanics and upgrades.
